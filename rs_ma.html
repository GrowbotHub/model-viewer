        <h1>Robotic Station</h1>
        <p>
            The robotic arm is equipped with a camera to check the growth stage of the plants. If it considers them ready, it grabs them
            to place them on a table accessible to the astronauts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The robot can plant seeds and pollinate flowers. It is also tasked with moving plants around the different Aeroponic Modules to
            make sure they all have enough space to grow.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="HotspotAnnotation Description" style="transform: translate(0, 15px); right: 2em;">
        <h1>Mixing Area</h1>
        <p>
            The Mixing Area aims to refill the aeroponic modules according to the plants' need.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is composed of tanks containing various solutions such as fertilizer, pH regulators,
            nutrient supplement and water. Each tank is connected to a pump, able to produce the exact volume
            of liquid necessary to obtain a solution matching the need of the plants.
